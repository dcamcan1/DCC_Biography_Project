        <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Danny Cannon was born in Louisville, Kentucky on August 18, 1995. His mother, Dannie, was a third grade teacher for Jefferson County and his father, Bob, was a business administrator for Rohm & Haas Company. He has four older siblings, but the age gap between Danny & his next older sibling is 13 years. While in high school, Danny worked at Walmart as a cashier and customer service manager for several years. He graduated from Louisville Male High School in 2013.</p>
        <h2>2013 to 2020</h2>
            <p>Following high school, Danny attended the <a href="https://uky.edu">University of Kentucky</a>. He changed his major multiple times (beginning with Biology Pre-Med) and finally settled on Public Health. During that time, he worked a variety of jobs such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Server at O'Charley's</li>
                <li>Pizza delivery boy at Mad Mushroom</li>
                <li>Bartender for weddings</li>
                <li>Program assistant for a state-level AIDS education program</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Danny graduated with a Bachelor of Public Health in 2016 & decided to enlist in the Army following graduation. He served as a medic in multiple roles, such as medic trainer in a clinic and supervisor in a field hospital. He left the Army in 2019 & moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, working as a landscaper and collections agent.</p>
        <h2>2020 to Present</h2>
            <p>In February 2020, Danny decided to return to Louisville & enroll in the Accelerated Nursing Program at <a href="https://bellarmine.edu">Bellarmine University</a>. After starting the program, he met his eventual-husband, Nick. Nick began the same program in 2021.</p>
            <p>Danny graduated from Bellarmine with a BSN in 2021 & began working as a registered nurse in the Emergency Department at <a href="https://nortonhealthcare.com/">Norton Healthcare</a>. After working two years, he became fatigued of bedside care & began to explore other career options. Having always been drawn to problem solving and coding, he began Bellarmine's Accelerated Software & Data Engineering program in May 2023. 
            <p>Nick & Danny were married in March 2023, but will be having a ceremony to celebrate with friends & family in September 2023. They have 3 fur babies - two pups and one cat. Nick is a pediatric nurse & has been supportive through Danny's endeavors. They both look forward to the future.</p>
